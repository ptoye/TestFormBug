# TestFormBug
 Project which can't be edited in GUI editor
 
Steps to reproduce:

1.	Open TestFormBug in NB 11.1 (I'm on Windows - don't know if the OS is relevant).
2.	If not already open, in package com.ptoye.testFormBug, open OuterPane.Java.
3.	Click on "Design" tab
4.	You should get an error message saying the file is corrupt. If you don't, your system is different from mine.
